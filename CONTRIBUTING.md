2. Create a feature request issue with:
   - Clear use case description
   - Why this would benefit users
   - Proposed implementation (if applicable)

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes** following our code style
4. **Test your changes**: `python run_tests.py all`
5. **Commit with clear messages**: `git commit -m "Add feature: description"`

```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints where applicable
- Use snake_case for functions/variables
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Critical Rules
1. **Emoji Handling**: ALWAYS use `convert_emoji_text()` from `utils/emoji_handler.py`
2. **File Operations**: Use `save_json_atomic()` and `load_json_safe()` from `utils/file_operations.py`
3. **Error Handling**: Use `log_error()` from `utils/error_handler.py`
4. **Design System**: Follow `gui/design_system.py` for UI consistency

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding user-facing features
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update type hints

## Privacy & Safety Principles

1. **Privacy-First**: All data local, no telemetry, explicit export only
2. **Safety-First**: Auto-pause on strain, research-based thresholds
3. **Inclusive**: MTF/FTM/NB support, non-prescriptive language
