## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (3.9+ recommended)
- Git for version control
- Microphone for testing audio features

### Development Setup
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Aria.git
   cd Aria
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Test the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Making Changes
1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test thoroughly** - especially audio-related features
4. **Commit with clear messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of changes"
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Comment complex audio processing algorithms

### Audio Development Notes
- **Test with various microphones** - built-in, USB, headsets
- **Consider different audio environments** - quiet vs. noisy
- **Validate across platforms** - Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Handle audio errors gracefully** - provide helpful error messages
- **Respect user privacy** - no audio data should be stored or transmitted

### Voice Training Considerations
- **Be inclusive** - support all voice training goals (MTF, FTM, non-binary)
- **Provide encouragement** - positive, supportive messaging
- **Respect expertise** - consult voice training professionals when possible
- **Consider accessibility** - features for different abilities
- **Safety first** - avoid features that could strain voices

## üß™ Testing
