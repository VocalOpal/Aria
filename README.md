## Application Files

The application creates and manages these files:
- `data/voice_config.json` - Your settings and training goals
- `data/voice_config_progress.json` - Session history and statistics
- `data/voice_config_analysis_history.json` - Audio analysis results and history
- `data/backups/` - Automatic configuration backups
- `logs/` - Application logs and error tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
- **No microphone input:** Check microphone permissions and connections
- **Poor pitch detection:** Adjust microphone sensitivity in Settings ‚Üí Microphone & Audio
- **Background noise:** Use the built-in noise learning (first 8 seconds of each session)

### Installation Problems
- **Windows:** May need Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for PyAudio
- **macOS:** Install PortAudio with `brew install portaudio`
- **Linux:** Install dependencies with `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`
- **PyQt6 Issues:** Ensure you have PyQt6 (not PyQt5) installed
- **Permission Issues:** May need to grant microphone access on macOS/Windows

### Analysis Issues
- **File not found:** Ensure complete file path, use quotes for paths with spaces
- **Analysis fails:** Verify supported format, check for actual voice content
- **Unexpected results:** Avoid background noise, multiple speakers, very short clips

## Training Tips

### For Beginners
1. **Start with audio analysis** - get personalized recommendations
2. **Use preset goals** - choose MTF, FTM, or Non-Binary presets as starting points
3. **Begin with exercises** - try the 5-minute warm-up routine
4. **Practice consistently** - short, frequent sessions work best

### Experienced Users
1. **Track your progress** - use the analysis history to monitor improvement
2. **Adjust goals progressively** - increase targets as you improve
3. **Focus on consistency** - stability is as important as pitch
4. **Combine techniques** - use live training, exercises, and regular analysis

### Voice Feminization Specific
- **Start around 165-180 Hz** and gradually work higher
- **Focus on resonance** - pitch alone doesn't create feminine voice
- **Practice daily** - voice training requires consistent muscle memory development  
- **Record regularly** - use audio analysis to track your progress objectively
