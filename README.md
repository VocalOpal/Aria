## Application Files

The application creates and manages these files:

- `data/voice_config_progress.json` - Session history and statistics
- `data/voice_config_analysis_history.json` - Audio analysis results and history

## Troubleshooting

- **Background noise:** Use the built-in noise learning (first 8 seconds of each session)

### Installation Problems
- **Windows:** May need Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for PyAudio
- **macOS:** Install with `brew install portaudio` 
- **Linux:** Install with `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`

### Analysis Issues
- **File not found:** Ensure complete file path, use quotes for paths with spaces
- **Analysis fails:** Verify supported format, check for actual voice content
- **Unexpected results:** Avoid background noise, multiple speakers, very short clips

## Training Tips

### For Beginners
1. **Start with audio analysis** - get personalized recommendations
2. **Use preset goals** - choose MTF, FTM, or Non-Binary presets as starting points
3. **Begin with exercises** - try the 5-minute warm-up routine
4. **Practice consistently** - short, frequent sessions work best

### Advanced Training
1. **Track your progress** - use the analysis history to monitor improvement
2. **Adjust goals progressively** - increase targets as you improve
3. **Focus on consistency** - stability is as important as pitch
4. **Combine techniques** - use live training, exercises, and regular analysis

### Voice Feminization Specific
- **Start around 165-180 Hz** and gradually work higher
- **Focus on resonance** - pitch alone doesn't create feminine voice
- **Practice daily** - voice training requires consistent muscle memory development  
- **Record regularly** - use audio analysis to track your progress objectively
